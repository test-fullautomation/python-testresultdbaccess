The \pkg\ package is designed to streamline the process of importing test data 
into the database of a test result web application. 

This package offers two distinct access methods: \textbf{Direct Access} and 
\textbf{REST API Access}. 

Users can seamlessly choose between these methods based on their preferences and 
requirements.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Direct Access:} This method provides a direct connection to 
          the database using the SQL protocol, allowing efficient data retrieval 
          and import operations.
    \item \textbf{REST API Access:} This method interacts with the web 
          application via HTTP/HTTPS protocol, providing flexibility and 
          compatibility with modern web architectures.
\end{itemize}

The package's DB Access Factory facilitates the creation of instances for both 
\textbf{Direct Access} and \textbf{REST API Access}, ensuring a smooth and 
adaptable workflow for importing test data into the target database. 

Whether users prefer direct database interaction or web-based API access, 
\pkg\ offers a comprehensive solution to meet diverse testing needs.
