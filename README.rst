Getting Started
---------------

The **TestResultDBAccess** package offers a flexible and efficient way to 
interact with the database of a test result web application. 

Users can choose between **Direct Access** and **REST API Access**, depending on 
their specific needs and preferences.

How to install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**TestResultDBAccess** can be installed in two different ways.

1. Installation via PyPi (recommended for users)

   .. code::

      pip install python-testresultdbaccess

   `TestResultDBAccess in PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/python-testresultdbaccess/>`_

2. Installation via GitHub (recommended for developers)

   * Clone the **python-testresultdbaccess** repository to your machine.

     .. code::

        git clone https://github.com/test-fullautomation/python-testresultdbaccess.git

     `TestResultDBAccess in GitHub <https://github.com/test-fullautomation/python-testresultdbaccess>`_

   * Install dependencies

     **TestResultDBAccess** requires some additional Python libraries. Before you install the cloned repository sources
     you have to install the dependencies manually. The names of all related packages you can find in the file ``requirements.txt``
     in the repository root folder. Use pip to install them:

     .. code::

        pip install -r ./requirements.txt

     Additionally install **LaTeX** (recommended: TeX Live). This is used to render the documentation.

   * Configure dependencies

     The installation of **TestResultDBAccess** includes to generate the documentation in PDF format. This is done by
     an application called **GenPackageDoc**, that is part of the installation dependencies (see ``requirements.txt``).

     **GenPackageDoc** uses **LaTeX** to generate the documentation in PDF format. Therefore **GenPackageDoc** needs to know where to find
     **LaTeX**. This is defined in the **GenPackageDoc** configuration file

     .. code::

        packagedoc\packagedoc_config.json

     Before you start the installation you have to introduce the following environment variable, that is used in ``packagedoc_config.json``:

     - ``GENDOC_LATEXPATH`` : path to ``pdflatex`` executable

   * Use the following command to install **TestResultDBAccess**:

     .. code::

        python setup.py install
